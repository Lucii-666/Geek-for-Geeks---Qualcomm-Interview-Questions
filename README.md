## üîç Problem Descriptions

### 1. Check for BST (`Check_for_BST.cpp`)
**Problem**: Given a binary tree, check if it's a valid Binary Search Tree (BST).

**Approach**: Uses recursive validation with min-max bounds for each node.

**Key Concepts**: 
- Binary Search Tree properties
- Tree traversal
- Boundary checking

---

### 2. Find the Length of Loop (`Find_the_Length_of_Loop.cpp`)
**Problem**: Given a linked list, find the length of the loop if it exists.

**Approach**: Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare) to detect loop, then count nodes in the loop.

**Key Concepts**:
- Floyd's Cycle Detection
- Two-pointer technique
- Linked list traversal

---

### 3. Implement strstr (`Implement_strstr.cpp`)
**Problem**: Implement the strStr() function to find the first occurrence of a pattern in a text.

**Approach**: Brute force pattern matching algorithm.

**Key Concepts**:
- String matching
- Pattern searching
- Nested loops optimization

---

### 4. Left View of Binary Tree (`Left_View_of_Binary_Tree.cpp`)
**Problem**: Print the left view of a binary tree (leftmost node at each level).

**Approach**: Level-order traversal (BFS) using queue, capturing the first node at each level.

**Key Concepts**:
- Binary tree traversal
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Queue data structure

---

### 5. Reverse a Linked List (`Reverse_a_linked_list.cpp`)
**Problem**: Reverse a singly linked list iteratively.

**Approach**: Three-pointer technique to reverse links between nodes.

**Key Concepts**:
- Linked list manipulation
- Pointer operations
- Iterative reversal

---

### 6. Reverse Bits (`Reverse_Bits.cpp`)
**Problem**: Reverse the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer.

**Approach**: Extract each bit from right to left and build the reversed number.

**Key Concepts**:
- Bit manipulation
- Bitwise operations
- Binary representation

---

### 7. Sort 0s, 1s, and 2s (`sort_0_1and_2.cpp`)
**Problem**: Sort an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s in a single pass.

**Approach**: Dutch National Flag Algorithm using three pointers (low, mid, high).

**Key Concepts**:
- Dutch National Flag Algorithm
- Three-pointer technique
- In-place sorting

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++, clang++, or Visual Studio)

# Example: Compile and run BST checker
g++ -o bst_check Check_for_BST.cpp
./bst_check
```

### For Visual Studio Code
1. Install C++ extension
2. Open any `.cpp` file
3. Press `Ctrl+F5` to compile and run
